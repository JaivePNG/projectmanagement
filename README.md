# A starter webpack project for React

I am using the Starter Webpack for This Project

This is a starter project that uses webpack to transpile and bundle ES6 React code. To use, clone this repo and then `npm install`.

To start the development server with a watcher that refreshes your browser, run `npm start`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/static`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.

# Explanation of The components

- FeedContainerhas state which acts on the props which are contained in Feed & Comment Form
